# 99Tech Code Challenge #1 #
I chose the front-end tab challenge, so I coded for problems 1, 2, and 3.
My solutions are located in the src folder.

## Problem 1:
I created a file named problem1.js in the problem1 folder to implement my solution.

## Problem 2:
In this challenge, I created a React.js application named currency-swap. 
Within it, I created a CurrencySwap component in the components folder to implement the main challenge.

## Problem 3:
Sure, I can review the proposed improvements in your code and explain why you implemented them in the WalletBalance.tsx file. 
I'll also take a look at the document-problem-3.md file for any improvement suggestions
